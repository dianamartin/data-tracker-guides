## About Work Orders

Work Orders are the process by which Signs & Markings work is requested, dipsatched, and completed. The overall workflow is:

1. A user creates a new work order which specifies the location and type of work to be completed.
2. If the user is not a technician, plans must be attached to the work order after it is created.
3. A supervisor reviews the work order and issues inidividual work tasks to workgroups.
4. Workgroups complete their work tasks.
5. An analyst reviews the work order and updates asset information in GIS.
6. A supervisor reviews the work order and closes it.


Each work order may have one of six statuses:

Status                  | Description|
:---                    | :--- |
**NEED TO BE ISSUED**   | The work order has been created but there are unissued tasks. |
**ISSUED**              | All tasks have been issued. |
**ON HOLD**             | The work order is on hold. See **HOLD REASON** for details. |
**NEEDS GIS**           | All tasks have been completed and the work order is ready for GIS Q/A Review |
**FINAL REVIEW**        | All tasks and GIS Q/A Review have been completed and the work order is ready for final review. |
**CLOSED**              | Final review is complete and the work order has been closed. |
